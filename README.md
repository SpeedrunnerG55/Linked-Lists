# Linked-Lists
create a list of student records
can add, delete, change any record.
also can search and display entire list.

# Uniqueness
student IDs are generated on entry so each record will always be unique.

# Stack and Queue
stack and queue variants are also available. Inherent with less functionality.

# 3 in one
List stack and que in one program! :O
share the same temp pointers and
share the same start pointer

# Temp pointers start pointer not global
All three list types but now with actual temporary temp pointers
but still share the same start pointer

# Start pointers not global
3 seperate start pointers are now defined in main for each type!
